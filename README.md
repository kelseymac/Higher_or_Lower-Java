# Higher_or_Lower Java
Remake of a card game I made in college, but this time in java

The game is using a deck of cards from which the dealer takes four. 
The dealer then asks four questions:
* is the first card red or black
* is the second card higher or lower than the first card
* is the third card in between or outside of the first two cards' values
* and what is the suit of the fourth card
